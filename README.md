# CharaKeep

    CharaKeep is a simple character manager for D&D games. Create, edit and delete a character using their very own character card.

## Installation

    Download file to desired location and unzip. It's that easy. 

## Opening 
    To open the page, in your terminal type: 
    ```open index.html```
    and then: 
    ```json-server --watch db.json```

## Features
    >Create a Character
    >Update a Character Description
    >Delete a Character
    >Delete a Character Achievement
    >Add a Character Achievement

## Description
    To create a character, click the New Character option at the top of the page. This toggles our character creation menu. 

    After creation, a user can select their character from the menu list to load their character's information to the detailed card below. 

    A user can then mouse over the card to view the character's description and achievements. If a user would like to edit the description, or add or remove a description, they can do so at the bottom of their respective sections. 

    When a user is done, they can simply close their browser as their created characters are saved to the database on creation.
